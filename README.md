# Database-Design-with-MYSQL-Workbench
## Intro
A new client "the owner of SereniCasa" recently contacted me with a request to develop a comprehensive database from scratch. This database will be designed to encompass and manage data related to customers, purchase orders, and employees for their business.

## Approach

I have attached the script that I utilized for this project, but I'd like to highlight a couple of points:
- Data Normalization: To achieve data normalization, I initially employed Excel and subsequently imported the normalized data into Workbench through the import wizard.
- User Privileges and Constraints: The configuration of user privileges and constraints was handled through the MySQL interface rather than by writing custom code.
